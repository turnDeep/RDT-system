## Conclusion for Volume Analysis
The ticker `FORM` shows strong signs of accumulation (Up/Down Volume Ratio = 1.47), which is a positive sign according to Minervini. However, the "Dry Up" condition (low volume on pullback or consolidation) is not met currently, as the recent volume (SMA 5) is significantly higher than the 50-day average. This suggests the stock might be in an active phase rather than a quiet consolidation phase, or the volume data reflects a recent breakout or high activity.
